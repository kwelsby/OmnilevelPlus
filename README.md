# OmnilevelPlus
3d printer leveller for the M5 Stick Plus.
Thanks to Dominick Lee for inspiration and his Instructable https://www.instructables.com/3D-Print-Bed-Leveling-Tool-Using-M5StickC/ .
I have created a new repository because I don't know better and there are significant changes.
I needed a lighter touch for my 3d printer hence replace resistor with 100K.
Added a feature to detect over-pressure and scale results to the maximum allowed - configurable.
And rearranged the screen for the M5 Stick Plus, did manage to find the M5 Stick C but it was dead on arrival...
I'll post a link to this from Thingiverse and including a simple HAT case to neaten the wiring.
